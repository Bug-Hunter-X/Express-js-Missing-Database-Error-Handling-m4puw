# Express.js Missing Database Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which fails to gracefully handle database errors.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

**Problem:**

The original code lacks error handling for database operations, which can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or cryptic 500 errors.  Specifically, it doesn't properly manage scenarios where `db.getUser()` encounters an error.

**Solution:**

The solution incorporates robust error handling using try...catch blocks, allowing for better control and more informative responses to users.  It also includes detailed logging to aid in debugging.
